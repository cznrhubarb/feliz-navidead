# feliz-navidead

Built for [ShenaniJam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/bscotch2019) with Alex and Bree Roberts from [Suckerbird Games](https://www.suckerbirdgames.com/). The theme we went with was **Cursemas Eve**.
It was done in 48 hours with a couple firsts for everyone on the team. It was a new engine ([Godot](https://godotengine.org/)) for Alex and I and Bree did all the art in a new-to-her pixel style.
